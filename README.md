Encrypter
=========

An encoding software that can be used to prevent your files for being exploit by intruders.

*) Encryption & Decryption of Data using RC4 (Substitution method)

i. Encryption will start by using a KEY but cannot totally depend upon the key.

ii. Encrypt data by RC4 algorithm that produces internal KEY by randomly generated Permutation of 256 character string.

iii. For being hacked it will take more than
6.5 x 107  years, (because of 256 permutations of the internal key technique.)

iv. Encrypt executable files quickly (because of encrypting few binaries of data).

v. Can be able to encrypt a specific file as well as directory having subdirectories and filesâ€¦
