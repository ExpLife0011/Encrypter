Can be used to prevent files for being exploit by intruders.

Encryption & Decryption of Data using RC4 (Substitution method)

i. Encryption will start by using a KEY but cannot totally depend upon the key.

ii. Encrypt data by RC4 algorithm that produces internal KEY by randomly generated Permutation of 256 character string.

iii. 256 permutations of the internal key technique.

iv. Encrypt executable files quickly (encrypting few binaries of data).
